# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using medical data. The model uses **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** classifiers to make predictions based on patient health indicators.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning modeling
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

## 📊 Features

- Built predictive models using Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
- Preprocessed data to handle missing values and normalize numerical features.
- Created insightful visualizations to explore correlations and trends for feature selection.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes patient health metrics such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol levels
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression, and more.

*(Data source: UCI Heart Disease dataset or similar – include link if public)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction

2. 📦 Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. ▶️ Run the heart disease prediction script
python heart_disease_prediction.py

# 📌 Results:
 - Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed well.
 - Random Forest had higher accuracy due to its ensemble learning ability.
 - Evaluated using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.

# ✅ Future Improvements:
 - Add a web interface using Flask or Streamlit.
 - Expand the dataset for better generalization.
 - Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
